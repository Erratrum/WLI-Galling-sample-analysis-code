This code has been modified by Domonic Kwok (Imperial College London) and Kit Kirby (Monash University).

The purpose of the code is to process optical profilometry data of a ASTM G196 type galled surface.

The input files are expected to be 3 column XYZ data in an .xyz file with spaces as column seperators.

The code has been writen to accept 2 types of metadata (14 lines of metadata or 3 lines of metadata) and can handle 1 line of non-float data at the end of the code.
